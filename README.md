# Notes
Opening the scenes in Unity may lead to some texture looking corrputed or not appearing at all due to me not including the meta files which I'll do when I have the time.
TextMeshPro was used in this.
Only works with 1920 by 1080 resolution I'll try to fix this later.
Mostly everything here was made and uploaded by Tumaini Donedison.
